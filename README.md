## 1D linearized Shallow Water Equations on a sphere
We consider the 1D linearized shallow water equations on a sphere.

In the animation we see how the periodic boundary conditions are imposed, when the two waves meet. 

## 2D idealised circular dam break problem
We consider the 2D SWE modelling an idealised circular dam break problem. Solved using the FVM.

Note that the boundary conditions simulate a wall, causing the water to bounce back into the domain.

## Shallow Water Equations on a sphere with initial Gaussian conditions
We consider the 2D SWE on a sphere with inital Gaussian conditions. Solved using the FVM.

Note, that since the SWE is solved in a 2D cartesian domain and wrapped to a sphere, we observe non-physical behaviour, especially close to the poles.
