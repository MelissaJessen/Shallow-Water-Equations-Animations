## 2D idealised circular dam break problem
We consider the 2D SWE modelling an idealised circular dam break problem. Solved using the FVM.

## SWE on a sphere with initial Gaussian conditions
We consider the 2D SWE on a sphere with inital Gaussian conditions. Solved using the FVM.

Note, that since the SWE is solved in a 2D cartesian domain and wrapped to a sphere, we observe non-physical behaviour, especially close to the poles.
